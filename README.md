# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3006](http://localhost:3006) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Additional information and Future Improvements

- To be able to use drag and drop events on mobile or desktop. You should start the page on the relevant environment. This is required because of the package I have used.(react-dnd)
- There is no "ordering" ability currently. This can be added as a future improvement. Items are now listed based on updatedAt by DESC. My guess, this can be completed within 2 more days.
- There is no pagination. This can be controversial since this is a to-do app and it might not be expected too many items to be on the screen. There are a lot of alternatives to keep the items under a number like removing items from db if they are old enough. Yet, pagination can be implemented by adding a button at the bottom of each column. Clicking on it will load items from the relevant status. This is more suitable to the current design.
- I think it is not required currently but language support might be added with i18n
- Of course a login system can be added as a future improvement
